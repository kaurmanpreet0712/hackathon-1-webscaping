# hackathon-1-webscaping

This project I made using hashtag#puppeteer and hashtag#node.js. It uses principles of webscraping and automation. 
This automation project does the following work:

*Fetches news from inshorts 
*Sends those news with headlines and description in whatsapp groups as well as Instagram. 
* Then read those headlines using voicemaker
